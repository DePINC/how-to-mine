# Mining Guide

**Essential Mining Setup: Step-by-Step Guide**

1. [Prepare DePINC Wallet](prepare-wallet.md)

You need to synchronize the DePINC blockchain data from the P2P network. This process typically takes 2-3 days, depending on your network speed and connectivity. Ensure a stable internet connection for optimal synchronization.

2. [Obtain farmer public-key](chia-wallet.md)

The mnemonic phrase and farmer public key are crucial elements to secure before initiating the plotting and mining processes. The mnemonic is required to make a signature for the block generated by your miner, while the farmer public key is essential for identifying your plots during mining operations. Ensure you have both properly generated and safely stored before proceeding to the next steps.

3. [Ploting](init-space.md)

Initialize disk space, also known as 'plotting'. The more space you initialize, the more coins you can potentially gain. This process involves creating plot files that are essential for mining operations. Ensure you have sufficient storage capacity before starting the plotting process.

4. [Prepare Timelord](timelord.md)

Timelord provides time-proofs, which are optional but highly recommended. We strongly suggest configuring your own timelord locally for optimal performance and security.

5. [Configure Miner](configure-miner.md)

Finally, with all the essential components in place for solo mining, you can proceed to configure your miner and begin the mining process. Ensure that all previous steps have been completed accurately before initiating your mining operations.
